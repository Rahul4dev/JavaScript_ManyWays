# JavaScript_ManyWays
It contains number of ways we can solve any Question.... Best for DSA and Machine Coding interviews

## Purpose of the Repository:
 - Give multiple ways to solve common problems
 
 - Refactoring of Code, helps in finding best complexity and best solution, however , we can't always use that in interview because it does include deliberate thinking and retrospection. but if we practice during preparation keeping the refactoring patterns in mind, in interviews, even though we do not give best solution but in conversation, we can convay that we know better solution which need some more time. Really help in getting good marks in interviews.
 
 - This repo will include multiple solutions of some questions, which can also be in the DSA repo, but here we mostly talk about the Refactoring of Code.
